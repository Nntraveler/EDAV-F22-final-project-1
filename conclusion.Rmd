# Conclusion

After conducting a detailed analysis on the dataset, we actually acquire lots of useful information. To be specific, by investigating the occurring time of the crime cases, we observe that most crime cases concentrated at the late evening and afternoon. The number of crime cases increased significantly from 15pm to 22pm, and decreased rapidly in the morning. This finding can be quite helpful when we are scheduling our trips. So in order to decrease the chances of encountering dangers, we should arrange our main events in the morning and early afternoon, 8am to 14pm. Secondly, by analyzing the age distribution of the victims, we can conclude that most victims are between 18-40. Compared with elders, these people have much longer time of staying outside, which increases the probility of exposing to dangers. Hence, people between 18-40 should be more alerted when they are travelling.

Even though we have extracted some useful information from the dataset, there actually exist several limitations during the analysis. First of all, in some columns like Crime Code or weapon description, they contains lots of missing values. For example, in weapon description, about 50% of the data are missing. This will affect the accuracy of our graph and conclusion, because we cannot be sure about why a category is more frequent than the other. It could be that another category is more frequent but main part of its data are missing. Therefore, missing data may provide us misleading information. Moreover, another limitation is that the dataset is transcribed from the crime reports that are typed on paper. Thus, since there are about 200k lines of data and each line contains 28 columns, there will surely exist some typos, which creates inaccuracies in our analysis.

From this project, we can learn some useful lessons. Firstly,
