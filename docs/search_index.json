If the basic safety cannot be guaranteed, we cannot enjoy the trip. Thus, what are the effective ways to ensure our own safety? To be specific, when we schedule the routes, we can avoid the areas that have high crime frequency. Also, since most crimes are occurred during the night, we can arrange all our activities during the daytime to reduce the possibilities of encountering dangers. Or we can avoid leaving valuable items in the vehicles. All these strategies are built on our understanding of crimes in that city. Therefore, how can we gain a comprehensive understanding of the criminal information in the city? One straightforward way is to investigate the dataset that contains specific details about all incidents of crimes. For this project, we mainly want to study the crimes occurred in Los Angeles. In this case, we found a dataset from the Los Angeles Open Data, which contains crime reports from 2020 to present. This dataset includes over 550k rows of data and 28 columns, which provides us sufficient amount of data for data analysis and data visualization. Specifically, the columns contain very specific information about crime, such as crime location, occurring time, victim description, or weapon status, etc. Hence, analyzing these columns will allow us to discover some patterns behind crimes like where they usually happen or in what kind of scenarios. For this project, we will use R for the data analysis and related visualization. As we know, R is a powerful language for data processing and statistical calculation, which is compatible with our goal. The project consists of 6 main parts: introduction, proposal, data, results, interactive component, and conclusion. In the proposal, we will briefly introduce the topic and list the conditions of our dataset. In the data section, we will give detailed information about the dataset and start to do data preprocessing like fill in missing value or process outliers. In the results and interactive component part, we will show the data analysis and what patterns we observe. Lastly, the conclusion part will summarize our findings and what we learn from this project. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic When we travel to a city, one part of our main concern is safety. When we schedule the tour routes, we will try to avoid those dangerous areas. In this case, we need to know more information about the crimes in that city, such as crime types, occurring time, or the area with high frequency, etc. And the most effective way to acquire these pieces of information is by investigating some datasets. Hence, for this project, we found a dataset from Los Angeles’ police department, which includes all kinds of information about local crimes, like crime type, crime area or victim info, etc. And by doing data visualization on the dataset will allow us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset in a short amount of time. The main topic that we want to discuss is how we should avoid crimes when we travel to Los Angeles. For example, we may avoid certain dangerous areas or schedule our main events during the daytime. By closely analyzing the dataset, we may discover some patterns which are relevant to crimes. Meanwhile, we will be able to discover more valuable information or measures to avoid those crimes and prevent dangers, which helps us to travel safely. 2.2 Data availability Data source: 1. Crime Data from 2020 to Present [Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8)) The data is collected in the city of Los Angeles, reflecting incidents of crime since 2020. It is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper Provided by Los Angeles Police Department Owner: LAPD OpenData Data format: CSV file 591K rows * 28 columns Three types of data: string(text), numbers, date columns: Date, Weapon used, Location Status, Latitude &amp; Longitude Frequency of update: Weekly Issues: Some columns like crime codes are extremely sparse, containing lots of missing values We need to spend tons of time on data cleaning. There are many categorical columns, which require some string transformation. And some other columns carry geographical information, so we should merge these columns to extract an exact location. For some text columns, the data inside are mostly abbreviations or codes, which cannot be directly used. In this case, we need to do some research and replace these codes with suitable formats that can be understood easily.

It reflects incidents of crime since 2020. The data inside is transcribed from the official crime report, and is typed from the paper, which means that there might be typos and inaccuracies. - Collected by Los Angeles Police Department, LAPD - Owner: LAPD OpenData - Date created: February 10, 2020 - Last Updated: November 2, 2022 Data Format: - CSV file - 595K rows and 28 columns - Three types of data: Plain text, Number, date - Update Frequency: weekly - Columns: Date occurring, area, criminal code, victim age, victim sex, weapon description, status, location, etc. - Each row is a crime incident Issues: Some columns like crime codes are extremely sparse, containing lots of missing values We need to spend tons of time on data cleaning.

For some text columns, the data inside are mostly abbreviations or codes, which cannot be directly used. In this case, we need to do some research and replace these codes with suitable formats that can be understood easily. Since there are about 600k datapoints, it is possible that two datapoints will overlap with each other. In this case, we may try convert it into log scale, or sample certain amount of datapoints, instead of using all of them.

Hence, in this section, we will visualize these missing values. From the graph above, we can observe the missing patterns in this dataset. To be specific, there are about 10 kinds of missing patterns in total. The missing values are mostly concentrated on four columns: Weapon_used,Crm_cd_2,Crm_cd_3, and Crm_cd_4. The most common missing pattern is that these four columns are all missed. The occurrences of this pattern exceed more than half of the dataset. The second most common missing pattern is that the crime codes 2,3,4 are all missing, which consists 1/3 of the dataset. Furthermore, by taking a closer look at the missing patterns, we can see that the “crm_cd_4” nearly appears in all the patterns, which means that it may have the highest number of missing values. From the previous graph, we conclude that the missing value are mostly concentrated on these four columns. Thus, this graph displays the proportion of missing values in these four columns. Specifically, we can see that the values in columns Crm_cd_3 and Crm_cd_4 are completely missed. For weapon_used, it has about 60% of missing values, while Crm_cd_2 has 95% of missing data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Number of cases along time 4.2 Occuring Time in each day 4.3 Age Distribution in victims 4.4 Sex Distribution in victims 4.5 Relation between Victim Age and Sex in Victims 4.6 Weapon Usage 4.7 Number of cases in spatial", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Number of cases along time From the plot above, we can see that if we take a closer look at each month, the number of crime cases goes up and down: it may increase rapidly at a certain time, and then decrease dramatically in the next month. So there seem not exist a deterministic pattern like crime cases will increase in a certain period of time. The trend here appears to be a little bit random. Moreover, another finding is that the number of crime cases drops dramatically recently. One possible reason is that the data points in recent period are not as dense as before, which gives us misleading information that the number cases decrease recently. 4.2 Occuring Time in each day First of all, we can observe that most crimes are concentrated during the late afternoon and evening while few are occurred in the morning. To be specific, the number of crime cases are over 30k from 15pm to 22pm. And at 12am, the number of cases start to decrease dramatically, reaching the lowest point at 5am. Then, it starts increases after 6am. The finding here is aligned with our intuition that criminals will usually perform crimes at night to avoid being caught. 4.3 Age Distribution in victims From the two plots, we can observe the overall distribution of the victims’ ages. First of all, the most dominant group is the 18-40 age group, which are generally adults. And the group with least crimes is “&gt;64” age group, which mainly consists of elders. One possible reason is that most elders will stay at home, which significantly reduce their chances of encountering crimes. However, for the adults, since they need to work, they need to stay outside for most of time, which increases the possibility of exposing to dangers. 4.4 Sex Distribution in victims From the histogram above, we can see that there are equal number of males and females in the victims. And other types of gender only occupy very small proportions. 4.5 Relation between Victim Age and Sex in Victims From the mosaic plot above, we can see that in the teenagers group, 0-18, there are more male victims than female ones. And in other groups, the number of male and female victims are very close. And as age increases, the proportions of male victims slightly increases, which suggests that male should take more cautions in their safety when they are travelling. And for the unspecified gender X, as age increases, its proportion decreases rapidly. 4.6 Weapon Usage From the graph above, we can observe that the most frequent type of weapon is the fist, which is often used in fights. This aligns with our intuition because fights are much more frequent compared with other types. Furthermore, the second most frequent weapon besides Other is the gun. Comparing with the fist, gun will usually cause more severe consequence. And when we are travelling, we should definitely avoid this type of crime. The remaining two types of weapons are sharp and blunt. Even though they will not create much damage as gun, tourists should try to avoid as well. 4.7 Number of cases in spatial The bar char shows the number of crime cases happened in every area. However, this does not reflect real spatial distribution We checked the longitude and latitude, and found that this AREA_NAME column can just reflect the police station. Note: We use sample to prevent crime cases being too dense to show in the LA map. As we can see in the graph, Most crime cases happened in the central area of LA Some other happened in the northwestern area of LA It seems intuitive that most crime cases are in the central part, which is consistent with our bar chart. To observe more information, We decided to explore details in the city center. Note: Here we use the full data to highlight the peak After we zoom into the central area: There are two peaks One is in Hollywood. Another is in the middle part, including Fashion District and Skid Row. To figure out the reason for this phenomenon, we collected some interesting statistics from Mapping L.A.. Although some data is not up-to-date, we still consider it as a reliable explanation for the distribution, since these population-related data will not change dramatically: Population density Obviously, high population density may lead to high number of crimes. The density in Hollywood is 22,193 people per square mile, among the highest densities for the city of Los Angeles. This can explain the relatively high crime density in that area. However, the downtown area only has 4,770 people per square mile, among the lowest densities for the city of Los Angeles, which means we can’t simply attribute the high crime rate to high population. Income In Hollywood, there is a $33,694 median household income (2008 dollars), low for the city of Los Angeles and low for the county In downtown, there is a $15,003 median household income (2008 dollars), low for the city of Los Angeles and low for the county Both areas are low in income, it makes sense that lower income leads to higher crime rate. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion After conducting a detailed analysis on the dataset, we actually acquire lots of useful information. To be specific, by investigating the occurring time of the crime cases, we observe that most crime cases concentrated at the late evening and afternoon. The number of crime cases increased significantly from 15pm to 22pm, and decreased rapidly in the morning. This finding can be quite helpful when we are scheduling our trips. So in order to decrease the chances of encountering dangers, we should arrange our main events in the morning and early afternoon, 8am to 14pm. Secondly, by analyzing the age distribution of the victims, we can conclude that most victims are between 18-40. Compared with elders, these people have much longer time of staying outside, which increases the probability of exposing to dangers. Hence, people between 18-40 should be more alerted when they are travelling. Third, we also visualize the number of cases in a spatial map. From the graph, we can observe that most cases cluster at the central area of LA, while some other cases concentrate in the northwestern part of LA. This provides valuable information about how we should plan our routes during the travel. Specifically, we should try to avoid the central and northwestern part of LA to reduce the chances of encountering dangers. And if we zoom in the central area, we can discover that crime cases are the most frequent in Hollywood and Fashion District. Hence, we should avoid these two areas during the trip. In conclusion, by conducting a series of exploratory analysis, we extract valuable information about how we should schedule our trips, like location, time, or contents. Even though we have extracted some useful information from the dataset, there actually exist several limitations during the analysis. First of all, in some columns like Crime Code or weapon description, they contains lots of missing values. For example, in weapon description, about 50% of the data are missing. This will affect the accuracy of our graph and conclusion, because we cannot be sure about why a category is more frequent than the other. It could be that another category is more frequent but main part of its data are missing. Therefore, missing data may provide us misleading information. Moreover, another limitation is that the dataset is transcribed from the crime reports that are typed on paper. Thus, since there are about 2000k lines of data and each line contains 28 columns, there will surely exist some typos, which creates inaccuracies in our analysis. Lastly, for the spatial graphs, we also have some limitations in displaying information. To be specific, due to the size of the figure, in order to ensure the readability of the graph, we cannot display all of the information but only part of the general patterns. From this project, we can learn some useful lessons. Firstly, we have more understanding about how to process numerical and categorical columns. To be specific, for numeric columns, we cannot directly visualize them in graph because there are too many numeric values, which will make the axis messy. In this case, we should categorize the values into groups, which will make our graph very clean. And by doing series of experiments, we need to pick the best cut for these values. Moreover, different numeric columns will have significantly different scales, some of them ranges between 1-10 while the others ranges between 1-10000. And plotting them directly will distort our graph. Hence, we should standardize them before the visualization. For categorical columns, we should be careful about the types of graph we visualize. Parallel coordinates plot or boxplot are not very suitable for discrete data. In this case, we should try to use mosaic plot or bar charts. Specifically, mosaic plots can be used to show the proportion relationship and bar charts are pretty effective in displaying the frequency. Moreover, another lesson that we learned is how to deal with overplotting. Overplotting means there are too many datapoints in the graph, which causes some of them to overlap. In our graph, there are about 2000k lines of data, so there are lots of overplotting. In this case, we can either try to use the log scale or sample only part of the total data to reduce the number of datapoints on the graph. In conclusion, this project not only allows us learn how to process numeric and categorical features, but also provides insights about how to solve overplotting problems. For the future, I would suggest to collect more kinds of criminal information. In this dataset, it includes information like victim sex, age, race, occurring time, location, weapon used, etc. However, it lacks the information of the criminals like their age and sex. These information are very important and useful because after having a deeper understanding about criminals, we can know how to avoid them. Hence, if we have more time, we would collect more information about these aspects, which will make our results more comprehensive and convincing. In conclusion, this project really opens the possibilities for the future research and study.
