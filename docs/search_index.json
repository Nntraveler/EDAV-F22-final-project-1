If the basic safety cannot be guaranteed, we cannot enjoy the trip. Thus, what are the effective ways to ensure our own safety? To be specific, when we schedule the routes, we can avoid the areas that have high crime frequency. Also, since most crimes are occurred during the night, we can arrange all our activities during the daytime to reduce the possibilities of encountering dangers. Or we can avoid leaving valuable items in the vehicles. All these strategies are built on our understanding of crimes in that city. Therefore, how can we gain a comprehensive understanding of the criminal information in the city? One straightforward way is to investigate the dataset that contains specific details about all incidents of crimes. For this project, we mainly want to study the crimes occurred in Los Angeles. In this case, we found a dataset from the Los Angeles Open Data, which contains crime reports from 2020 to present. This dataset includes over 550k rows of data and 28 columns, which provides us sufficient amount of data for data analysis and data visualization. Specifically, the columns contain very specific information about crime, such as crime location, occurring time, victim description, or weapon status, etc. Hence, analyzing these columns will allow us to discover some patterns behind crimes like where they usually happen or in what kind of scenarios. For this project, we will use R for the data analysis and related visualization. As we know, R is a powerful language for data processing and statistical calculation, which is compatible with our goal. The project consists of 6 main parts: introduction, proposal, data, results, interactive component, and conclusion. In the proposal, we will briefly introduce the topic and list the conditions of our dataset. In the data section, we will give detailed information about the dataset and start to do data preprocessing like fill in missing value or process outliers. In the results and interactive component part, we will show the data analysis and what patterns we observe. Lastly, the conclusion part will summarize our findings and what we learn from this project. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic When we travel to a city, one part of our main concern is safety. When we schedule the tour routes, we will try to avoid those dangerous areas. In this case, we need to know more information about the crimes in that city, such as crime types, occurring time, or the area with high frequency, etc. And the most effective way to acquire these pieces of information is by investigating some datasets. Hence, for this project, we found a dataset from Los Angeles’ police department, which includes all kinds of information about local crimes, like crime type, crime area or victim info, etc. And by doing data visualization on the dataset will allow us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset in a short amount of time. The main topic that we want to discuss is how we should avoid crimes when we travel to Los Angeles. For example, we may avoid certain dangerous areas or schedule our main events during the daytime. By closely analyzing the dataset, we may discover some patterns which are relevant to crimes. Meanwhile, we will be able to discover more valuable information or measures to avoid those crimes and prevent dangers, which helps us to travel safely. 2.2 Data availability Data source: 1. Crime Data from 2020 to Present [Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8)) The data is collected in the city of Los Angeles, reflecting incidents of crime since 2020. It is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper Provided by Los Angeles Police Department Owner: LAPD OpenData Data format: CSV file 591K rows * 28 columns Three types of data: string(text), numbers, date columns: Date, Weapon used, Location Status, Latitude &amp; Longitude Frequency of update: Weekly Issues: Some columns like crime codes are extremely sparse, containing lots of missing values We need to spend tons of time on data cleaning. There are many categorical columns, which require some string transformation. And some other columns carry geographical information, so we should merge these columns to extract an exact location. For some text columns, the data inside are mostly abbreviations or codes, which cannot be directly used. In this case, we need to do some research and replace these codes with suitable formats that can be understood easily. (If we had any questions about the dataset, there is a button in the original webpage, which allows us to contact the dataset owner) Plan to import: Download the csv file from the website Preprocess data for convenience : Replace columns containing spaces such as “DATE OCC” to “DATA_OCC” Remove character “-” We plan to import the csv data into MySQL database deployed on the server and visit these data through odbc package, so that it might be easier to collaborate on data.

It reflects incidents of crime since 2020.

For some text columns, the data inside are mostly abbreviations or codes, which cannot be directly used. In this case, we need to do some research and replace these codes with suitable formats that can be understood easily. Since there are about 600k datapoints, it is possible that two datapoints will overlap with each other. In this case, we may try convert it into log scale, or sample certain amount of datapoints, instead of using all of them.
